This script should be executed for initial deployment of vEPC i.e. before executing all other scripts.
To execute the script, go into the vEPC directory in control node where you have copied the scripts and enter the following command:
	$ python vEPC_deploy.py
First the script checks if VCM and EMS images exist and if not creates both the images
When the script runs, it checks if vEPC is been deployed previously it will prompt the user to run vEPC_termination.py and exits.
Then it creates availability zones on the basis of host-names of compute nodes and those zones will be added to host aggregate groups
After that it creates the networks S1 and SGi
Now script will start deploying VCM-1 components on Compute 1 and VCM-2 components on Compute 2
