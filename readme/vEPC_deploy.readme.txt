This script should be executed for initial deployment of vEPC
To execute the script, go into the vEPC directory in control node where you have copied the scripts and enter the following command:
	$ python vEPC_deploy.py
First the script checks if VCM and EMS images exist and if not creates both the images
Then it checks if availability zones exists and if not creates availability zones on the basis of host-names of compute nodes and those zones will be added to host aggregate groups
After that it starts creating Heat stack.
After successful creation of heat-stack, configurations of VNFCs are started and status of VNFCs are displayed on CLI.
