The script should run after successful execution of scale_up.py of vEPC scripts
To execute the script, go into the vEPC directory in control node where you have copied the scripts and enter the following command:
	$ python scale_down.py
This script prompts the user if surely it needs to scale down the vEPC
If user selects yes, script starts scaling down for unit value and terminates single instance of each SDB, CPE and DPE
