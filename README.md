# Dell vEPC Tester Tool

## Objective
The objective of this project is to design and develop a vEPC tester tool to perform conformance and performance testing of Virtualized Evolved Packet Core. The system being tested would be third party vendor software hosted on Dell NFVI platform.
This tester tool should be able to generate traffic on LTE interfaces i.e. S1-MME, S1-U and S-Gi. The traffic should be in compliance to ETSI standard protocols.
The tester tool would be able to simulate LTE-Uu (between UE and eNode B) and X2 interface (between multiple eNodeBs). It would also be capable of triggering Handover scenarios over X2 interface.
