The script should run after successful execution of scale_up.py of vEPC scripts
To execute the script, ssh into 10.204.110.42 and go the directory /root/vEPC_scripts and enter the following command:
	$ python scale_down.py
This script prompts the user if surely it needs to scale down the vEPC
If user selects yes, script starts scaling down for unit value and terminates single instance of each SDB, CPE and DPE
