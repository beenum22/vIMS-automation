This script should be executed after initial deployment of vEPC has been done
If this script is executed before initial deployment of vEPC, it will exit with a message saying that initial deployment script needs to be executed first
To execute the script, go into the vEPC directory in control node where you have copied the scripts and enter the following command:
	$ python scale_up.py
Scale-up works on the basis of unit value i.e. it will deploy single instance of SDB, CPE and DPE each time it runs
