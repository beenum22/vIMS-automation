This script should be executed after initial deployment of vEPC has been done
If this script is executed before initial deployment of vEPC, it will exit with a message saying that initial deployment script should be executed first
To execute the script, ssh into 10.204.110.40 and go the directory /root/vEPC_scripts and enter the following command:
	$ python scale_up.py
Scale-up works on the basis of unit value i.e. it will deploy single instance of SDB, CPE and DPE each time it runs
