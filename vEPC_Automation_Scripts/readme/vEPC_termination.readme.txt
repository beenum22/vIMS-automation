This script should be executed after successful execution of scale_down.py of vEPC scripts
To execute the script, ssh into 10.204.110.40 and go the directory /root/vEPC_scripts and enter the following command:
	$ python vEPC_termination.py
First the script checks if VCM and EMS images exist and if not creates both the images
This script terminates the initial deployment of vEPC including networks created for it
After completely terminate the vEPC, it prompts the user if it wants to delete EMS and based on the input (yes/no) performs the required action
Then it prompts the user if it wants to delete aggregate groups too and based on the input (yes/no) performs the required action
In the end it prompts the user whether it wants to delete VCM and EMS images and if user selects yes it deletes the images
