This script should be executed for initial deployment of vEPC i.e. before executing all other scripts.
To execute the script, ssh into 10.204.110.40 and go the directory /root/vEPC_scripts and enter the following command:
	$ python vEPC_deploy.py
If vEPC is been deployed previously this script will prompt to terminate the previous deployment and if user enters 'no' script will exit immediately
If VM's exist and user enters 'yes', it will start terminating the all the 7 VM's and delete the networks S1 and SGi
After successful termination of vEPC, the script starts creating two new networks S1 and SGi
Availability zones will be created on the basis of host-names of compute nodes and those zones will be added to host aggregate groups
Now script will start deploying vEPC and all its components on compute node 1
